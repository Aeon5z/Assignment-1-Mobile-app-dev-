What problem your app is solving / What needs your app is fulfilling / Intended users?

The purpose of the app that I intend to create is one that’s able to make a decision for you by randomly selected one of the choices in which you provided. For instance, a question that I’ve seen toss around between friends and family is “where should we eat” and usually a lot of choices gets thrown up in the air on what they want and the final decision usually gets delayed by a extended amount of time between all the discussing. So in a nutshell my app is for an indecisive person/ group to be able to come a decision faster or at the very least without the prolonged discussions and well just for the kicks of it, seeing a list of things you want and then getting randomly selected seems kinda interesting.
